Currently, I am a second year PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl) with [Herke van Hoof](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.c.vanhoof/homepage/) and [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). My research focuses on active learning and active sensing through reinforcement learning.

Some of my other interests include everything Bayesian, Magic: the Gathering, and musical theater.
