I'm a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl) with [Herke van Hoof](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.c.vanhoof/homepage/) and [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). My research focuses on active learning and active sensing through reinforcement learning.

Other interests include AI4Science, everything Bayesian, effective altruism, and musical theater.
