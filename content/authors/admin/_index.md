I'm a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl) with [Herke van Hoof](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.c.vanhoof/homepage/) and [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). My research primarily focuses on active learning and active sensing for high-tech applications, such as MRI and molecular simulations. Completed research internships at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and Qualcomm AI Research.

Other interests include [AI alignment](https://www.tbbakker.nl/post/2023_05_alignment/), [everything Bayesian](https://www.tbbakker.nl/post/2021_03_bayes_commentary/), [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), and musical theater.

I have recently spoken about the (existential) risks of AI at the Dutch National AI Debate, [Pakhuis de Zwijger](https://dezwijger.nl/programma/existential-risks-of-artificial-intelligence), the Dutch Ministry of Defence, and the [University of Amsterdam](https://aisafetyamsterdam.com/panel-discussion-on-ai-safety).
