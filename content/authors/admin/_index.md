I'm a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl) with [Herke van Hoof](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.c.vanhoof/homepage/) and [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). My research primarily focuses on active learning and active sensing for high-tech applications, such as MRI and molecular simulations. Currently on research internship at Qualcomm AI, previously at Facebook AI Research (FAIR).

Other interests include everything Bayesian, [effective altruism](https://www.eaamsterdam.org/), and [musical theater](https://www.hetaspk.nl/).

I have recently spoken about the (existential) risks of AI at [Pakhuis de Zwijger](https://dezwijger.nl/programma/existential-risks-of-artificial-intelligence) and the Dutch Ministry of Defence. Please reach out if you're interested in a similar talk.
