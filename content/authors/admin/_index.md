I've recently started my position at Qualcomm AI as a senior ML researcher on LLM reasoning and safety. I'll soon be defending my PhD from the [Amsterdam Machine Learning lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl) with [Herke van Hoof](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.c.vanhoof/homepage/) and [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). I've completed research internships at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and Qualcomm AI Research.

Some of my interests include [AI safety](https://www.tbbakker.nl/post/2023_05_alignment/), [everything Bayesian](https://www.tbbakker.nl/post/2021_03_bayes_commentary/), [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), and [musical theatre](https://www.hetaspk.nl/).

I am concerned about the risks of [transformative AI](https://www.tbbakker.nl/post/2023_05_alignment/), and have spoken on this at the Dutch National AI Debate, [Pakhuis](https://dezwijger.nl/programma/existential-risks-of-artificial-intelligence) de [Zwijger](https://dezwijger.nl/programma/the-future-of-ai-too-much-to-handle), the Dutch Ministry of Defence, and the [University of Amsterdam](https://aisafetyamsterdam.com/events/2023_10_18/).
